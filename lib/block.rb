# Provides an abstraction for performing boolean operations on a numerical range.
# Used for calculating the interaction of free and busy time periods on a schedule.
#
# A Block is a VALUE OBJECT which has a starting value (called `top` or `start`)
# and an ending value (called `bottom` or `end`). These properties are numeric
# values which could represent points in time, or an arbitrary numeric scale.
#
# Blocks can be combined and subtracted from one another to yield other blocks
# or arrays of blocks depending on whether the original blocks are contiguous or not.
#
# For example:
#   Addition of overlapping ranges:
#   Block.new(3, 8) + Block.new(5, 12) == Block.new(3, 12)
#
#   Subtraction of one block from the middle of another:
#   Block.new(5, 25) - Block.new(10, 20) == [Block.new(5, 10), Block.new(20, 25)]
#
